- 000000 stuff at top, check diff amiga / arcade at line 807 (space vs 0) 163B 163F
- maybe scaling should be increased: highscore could stand a scaling of 0
  (no scaling, no 0x40 scaling!)
- crash on demo when reaching planet
- identify all JSRLS to optimize draws/erase: letters & symbols & 
  planets/all ROM objects 
  


graphics optimization: logging should identify all JSRL ROM address
  for all objects. Then we figure out which zoom factor is the most
  displayed and we pre-draw the bobs (once resolution has been settled)
  for some given zooms (intercept JSRL calls and check resolutions where
  a BOB is available)

- ECS: 8 colors, no intensity
- AGA: 8 colors, 8 intensities
